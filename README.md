# Dog-Breed-Detection
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a dog breed classifier using transfer learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models to adapt to a specific task. In this case, we use the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to classify different dog breeds using the Stanford Dogs dataset.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* TensorFlow 2.0+
* Keras
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* OpenCV (for preprocessing custom images)
* Numpy, Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* scikit-learn

## Usage
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Run the VGG16.ipynb file on Google Colab to train the model on the MNIST dataset. This will also save the trained model.
* The test and everything else are in the code; if you follow the code and read the comment, you will understand what it does.
* To test the model on your own handwritten digits, preprocess your image by replacing the "sss.png" file, and then see the prediction.

## Conclusion
* This project demonstrates the application of transfer learning using pre-trained CNN models for image classification tasks. By leveraging the knowledge captured by models like VGG16, you can build powerful classifiers with limited resources and data.
* The results of the dog breed classification are displayed in the form of a classification report. This report includes metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each dog breed class.
